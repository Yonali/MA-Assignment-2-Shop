Middleware Architecture Assignment 2 – REST API- We you have been asked to develop a collaborative shopping platform. Following are the requirements given by the client and/or the Business Analyst. 

•	The system should have a web interface where buyers can shop for items uploaded by sellers. 
•	A service should be there where sellers can add/update/delete items.
•	A service should be there where buyers can search/buy items. 
•	A buyer may buy multiple items. 
•	Once an item or a collection of items are bought, the buyer may select the delivery option, where a request may be sent to a delivery service (so there should be a third-party delivery service).
•	The payment for the items bought can be made using credit cards or using the mobile phone number (which would be added to the user’s mobile bill).
•	The system can connect to a payment gateway for credit card transactions. The information that should be submitted includes the credit card number, amount, CVC number (3 digit no. at the back of the credit card) and card holder’s name. 
•	The users can choose to make the payment using a mobile service provider’s service to credit the mobile bill. The information that should be transferred includes the mobile phone number, a four digit pin number and the amount to be charged. 
•	Once the payment is made the user should be given a confirmation of the appointment via SMS and email.
